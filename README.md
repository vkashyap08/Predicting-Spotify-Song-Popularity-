# Predicting-Spotify-Song-Popularity

I am a Masters in Data Science student at the University of San Francisco. For my MSDS699 (Machine Learning Laboratory) final project, I chose to practice what I've learned by predicting song popularity of songs in the Kaggle Spotify dataset. 

As an avid Spotify user, I was initially intrigued by the AI bot that could "judges your awful taste in music". Here is the link for those who aren't afraid of getting roasted: https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/. In the future, I'd love to create a song recommendation system since I'm always in need of some new music, but for this project I wanted to see if I could accurately predict a song's place on the Top Charts from features such as "acousticness", "danceability", and "energy".
